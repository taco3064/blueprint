# @kekkai/blueprint — repo conventions

This package *is* the tool that generates architecture contracts. It should
live by the subset of its own handbook that applies to a Node library. It is
**not** a front-end app, so the layer model it emits (`pages → … → services`,
aliases, framework primitives) does **not** apply to this repo — the handbook
ideas below do.

## Module shape (enforced by convention, checked in review)

- **One module = one folder** with a single public entry `index.ts`. The
  implementation file is named after the module, never `main` — e.g.
  `emit/lint/lint.ts`, `inspect/inspect.ts`. Satellites keep semantic names
  (`plan.ts`, `scan.ts`, `analyze.ts`, `patterns.ts`, `sections.ts`).
- **Entry-only imports across modules.** Import another module through its
  folder (`../config`, `../project`, `../markdown`), never a deep path
  (`../config/graph`). Within a module, use relative paths (`./types`).
- **No `utils` junk drawer.** A shared file earns a name for what it does
  (`markdown`, `patterns`), or lives private to its module.
- **Emitters are pure and deterministic** (`emit*`, `defineBlueprint`,
  presets). Side effects live only in the runtimes (`bootstrap`, `inspect`,
  `cli`) and are split plan (pure) / apply (I/O).

## Layering (one-way, low → high)

`config` → `markdown` → `plugin` → `emit/*` → `presets` → `project` →
`inspect` → `survey` / `impact` → `bootstrap` → `cli`. A module imports only
from lower ones (survey reads inspect's scan; bootstrap embeds the survey in
its authoring playbook).
`project` is the shared reader (`detect` + `resolveBlueprint`) for both
runtimes; `plugin` is the embedded ESLint plugin (plain rule objects, no
internal deps) that `emit/lint` ships inside its output.

## Self-explaining output (every CLI / runtime message)

An adopting agent's only guaranteed in-context channel is the output of the
command it just ran — the playbook and docs were read long before the doubt
arises, and its priors ("tools usually behave like X") fill every gap the
output leaves. So **every message that reports a side effect (write / rm),
or a behavior that contradicts common tool intuition, carries its cause and
the next step in the same line.** Two truths without a bridge read as a
contradiction ("Adoption complete" beside "vacuous"); an effect without a
stated cause reads as breakage (a deletion blamed on a config field that
is not in the config). Field batches 10–12 are the case law.

## Tests & tooling

- **Co-locate tests**: `foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`; the test name matches the
  source.
- **`src/conformance/` is the adoption conformance suite** — every field-
  feedback scenario fossilized as an offline fixture repo driven through the
  real CLI (and the real eslint from this repo's devDeps). When field testing
  finds a new adoption failure, its fixture lands here with the fix; field
  runs should only ever discover *new* scenarios. Test-only: never exported
  from the package entry.
- **100% coverage** (`vitest --coverage`). The only exclusions are real-I/O
  defaults and the bin guard, marked `/* v8 ignore */` because tests inject
  those effects (`exec`, `loadConfig`) instead of running them.
- **Formatting is ESLint-driven** (`@stylistic/*`); there is no Prettier. Run
  `npm run lint` / `eslint . --fix`. Enforcement rules mirror the handbook
  stance: never `eslint-disable` to dodge a rule; fix the structure.
- Verify a change with `lint` + `tsc` + `test` + `build`, and drive the CLI
  end-to-end (`node dist/bin.js init|inspect`) for runtime changes.
- **`npm run field:run` is the live adoption harness** (`scripts/field-run.mjs`):
  packs the local tree (no publish), stages scenario repos in a temp dir, runs
  the adoption prompt through each available agent CLI headlessly, verifies
  with the real doctor/inspect, and collects the structured feedback file into
  one report — filed as a `field-run` GitHub issue, the triage inbox.
  Conformance guards known scenarios; the harness hunts new ones. Triage flow:
  consolidate the issue's findings, judge each (fix / by-design / reject),
  land fixes with conformance fixtures, close the issue referencing the
  commits — the closed issue is the public record of what shaped the release.
  `--dry` stages without spawning agents; `--repo <path>` adds the
  existing-repo scenario from a local clone; `--no-issue` keeps it local.
